<p>Figures is a free, open-source, simple-to-use, flexible money management application.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is light-weight and fast, and stores your data in a SQLite database which can be optionally encrypted.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can import and export your data in OFX or QIF formats.</p>
<p>Figures allows you to track your banking and credit card transactions by spending categories while at the same time you control how the transactions are displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides powerful search options so you can quickly and easily find transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Figures has a flexible report generator so you can summarize your transactions any way you like.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>
<p>The tool that gives you complete control of your transactions is the Figures filter.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your bank gives you a transaction with a description like "THE HOME DEPOT THE HOME DEPOT #2", you can define a filter that searches for the words "HOME DEPOT" anywhere in the description.&nbsp;&nbsp;When it finds it, the filter will change the description to simply "Home Depot".&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the filter will apply a spending category to the transaction, such as "Hardware".&nbsp;&nbsp;Filters can also flag a transaction as tax deductible.</p>
<p>The panel you use to define a filter looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" style="padding:1px;" src="Define%20Filter%20Screen.jpg"></p>
<p>Filters can be defined on descriptions or memos. &nbsp;Once you have defined a filter, it will be applied each time you load transactions into Figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;The original description and memo text is saved in the Figures file, so you can add, change, or delete filters at any time, and re-apply them to your transactions.</p>
<h2>Search</h2>
<p>The main account panel looks like this:</p>
<p><img width="1200" height="758" alt="" style="padding:1px;" src="Accounts.jpg"></p>
<p>All the buttons in the app have clear, easy-to-understand text descriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The search panel at the left allows you to search for transactions by date, amount, type, and category.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can sort the transactions by clicking on the column headers.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can export your search results as a PDF, to HTML, or as an Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions are categorized using filters, or you can split a transaction into two or more categories (see the Empire Records transaction above).</p>
<h2>Reports</h2>
<p>The report panel looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" style="padding:1px;" src="Define%20Report.jpg"></p>
<p>The example above shows how you would create a monthly spending report.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just check the Month and Category boxes to summarize by month and category.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then select one or more accounts in the Accounts drop-down, select Withdrawals Only in the Transactions section, and check the All box in the Categories section.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you run the report you can select the date range you want to see.</p>
<p>The report looks like this:</p>
<p><img width="1200" height="758" alt="" style="padding:1px;" src="Report.jpg"></p>
<p>You can export the report as a PDF, to HTML, or as an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
